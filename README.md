# Otis Frontend Mentor Challenges Repository

## Main Target

This repository is dedicated to completing all challenges from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) with my own learning goals, custom tech stack, and best practices. Each solution will demonstrate modern frontend development, CI/CD, testing, and documentation.

## Repository Structure

- Challenges are organized by difficulty level (e.g., `1-newbie-level/`, `2-junior-level/`, etc.).
- Each challenge is placed in its own subfolder inside the appropriate level folder.
- Each challenge may use a different tech stack, CI/CD pipeline, testing approach, and documentation (e.g., Storybook, unit tests).
- Example structure:
  ```
    otis-frontendmentor-challenges
    ├── 1-newbie-level
    │   └── qr-code-component-main
    │       └── ...
    └── 2-junior-level
        └── some-other-challenge
            └── ...
  ```

## Tech Stack & Practices

- Solutions may use:
  - React, Vue, Svelte, Vanilla JS, or other frameworks
  - CSS Modules, SCSS, Tailwind, or custom CSS
  - Webpack, Vite, or other bundlers
  - Storybook for UI documentation
  - Jest, Vitest, or other testing tools
  - GitHub Actions or other CI/CD for automated builds and deployments

## Contribution & Learning

- Each challenge is an opportunity to:
  - Try new technologies and patterns
  - Practice code quality (linting, formatting, testing)
  - Automate workflows (CI/CD)
  - Document solutions for future reference
